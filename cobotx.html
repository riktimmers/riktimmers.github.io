<h1>Cobotx Work Experience</h1>

<h2>Programming and User Interface</h2>
<p>
  At the beginning Cobots where programmed using their own scripting languages running on the Teach Pendant. Because of
  limitations with the User Interface and IOs for controlling peripherals we switched to using an IPC running Ubuntu,
  such that the Cobot can be programmed using c++ and a User Interface with Flutter/Dart. <br>
  The User Interface allows control for one or more cobots, show Safety Scanner status, allow product selection and
  show other information that is required. <br>
  For controlling conveyors, pushers and reading out sensors either a PLC was used, or the IPC was used in combination
  with a Modbus TCP Remote IO module. <br>


</p>

<h2>Palletizer</h2>
<p>
  Programmed multiple palletizer using different Cobots; UR10e, UR20, Doosan H2017, P3020.
  The project could be as simple as a single product with a single pattern, to multiple products requiring different end
  effectors and different stacking patterns. Sometimes multiple vacuum groups are used for multi pick and multi place
  operations.
  In certain case a lift was mounted under the Cobot to allow for a higher stacking reach.
  <br>
  The software has been improved over the years by allowing configurations to be done using YAML/JSON files, this way
  commissioning engineers can configure the Cobot including its trajectory and stacking patterns requiring less
  hardcoded Cobot motions.
