<h1>Cobotx Work Experience</h1>

<h2>Programming and User Interface</h2>
<p>
  At the beginning Cobots where programmed using their own scripting languages running on the Teach Pendant. Because of
  limitations with the User Interface and IOs for controlling peripherals we switched to using an IPC running Ubuntu,
  such that the Cobot can be programmed using c++ and a User Interface with Flutter/Dart. <br>
  The User Interface allows control for one or more cobots, show Safety Scanner status, allow product selection and
  show other information that is required. <br>
  For controlling conveyors, pushers and reading out sensors either a PLC was used, or the IPC was used in combination
  with a Modbus TCP Remote IO module. <br>
